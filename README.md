## Selenium it is suit which consists four different components IDE RC WebDriver and grid.

WebDriver is automation testing tool just like IDE RC grid.

Selenium is one of the most widely used open source tool in market.

Selenium only support web application.


It was developed by Jasson huggins.

Selenium supports multiple different platforms browsers and programming languages.

Winium which is the sister of Selenium use for desktop applications like windows applications.

**Platform:-** p windows Linux Solaris Mac / OS

**Browsers:-** Chrome Firefox IE

**Programming languages:-** Java c# perl ruby 

**Pre-req to learn Selenium :-** Basic understanding of Java

**Automation Testing:-** it is process to automate any software application.
This process uses the specialised tools to automatic execution of manually designed test cases without any manual intervention.
By the help of Automation Testing tool we can access this data as well as we can compare actual and expected result.
Automation Testing cover both functional and nonfunctional testing.
Functional automation is used for automation of functional test cases. Performance automation is used for automation of non functional test cases.

**Functional automation tools are as below:-**

> Selenium :- open source

> QTP :- provide by HP

> Rational robot :- provided by IBM

> Coded UI :- provided by Microsoft

> Auto IT :- open source

**Non-functional automation:-** 

> Loadrunner :- provided by HP

> Jmetre:-  provided by Apache

> Zap :- open source

**Sdlc software development life cycle**

**Stlc software testing life cycle**

**ATLC Automation Testing life cycle**

**Automation Testing life cycle:-**  Phases

> Test automation feasibility analysis

> Test tool selection

> Find scope of automation

> Planning script design and development

> Test execution

> Automation maintenance

If we can open any website for example Facebook whatever you can see or web element.
If you want to locate anything on a webpage so we gonna use locators (first we have to right click then go for inspect)
API is the medium to perform any operation between database and user interface so basically it's a carrier.

**Selectorhubs is xpath.**


We perform below besic 
> operation on any web page :- click()
 Enter data 
mouse hover 
scroll

> Method types in Selenium:-
first webdriver methods 
second web element operational methods

*System.Setproperty ("webdriver.chrome.driver","D:\\softwares\\cromedriver_win32\\chromedriver.exe");* 
###### Here system is our pre defined class 
###### And set property is predefined method of system class 

**WebDriver is an interface.**
Automation script in deal with 2 methods:- 
*WebDriver methods*

*Web element operational methods*

#. close(): It is used to close the current window. If there are multiple windows, it will close the current window which is active.

#. quit(): It is use dto quit all associated window which is opened.
